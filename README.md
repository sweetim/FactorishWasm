Features
--------

This project is a demonstration that how plain HTML5 and JavaScript can be used to create a game
with complexity like the great game [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/).


Prerequisites
-------------

This game uses pure JavaScript, no additional plugins are required on your side.
You need a decent browser though.

The game state is saved into your browser, which is entirely in the client side.
If you want to continue playing with a different device, you'll need to serialize the game state
and copy it to another device.


Libraries
---------

This project doesn't depend on an extenal library (yet).
